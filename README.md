                    Dr Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as APJ Abdul Kalam, was known for being one of the most valued persons in the country because of his simplicity and ideologies. His 
                   rise from a humble family background to one of the most famous scientists in the world is quite phenomenal. He has set an example for all by achieving his dreams and fighting against all 
                    adversities since his childhood. Despite his struggle against poverty in his early days, he never gave up his education and he also continued to support his family.
                    Additionally, his contribution to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the educational sector has been remarkable. He was the man behind Indiaâ€™s Agni and Prithvi missiles. Apart 
                   from that, Dr Kalam became the 11th President of India in 2002 and he was often seen interacting with students encouraging them to achieve their dreams.

                 
                    
                    
                    Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
                    The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory 
                    was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.[47] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,[48] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[49] Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.[50] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[51]
                    
                    
                    
                    In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.[61][62][63][64]
                    
                    
                    
                    Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.[69][70][71] After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a number of people supporting his candidature.[72][73] The BJP potentially backed his nomination[failed verification], saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential election.[74][75] A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam.[76] Indian National Congress opposed the nomination of Kalam in 2012.[77] Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter.[78] On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so:
